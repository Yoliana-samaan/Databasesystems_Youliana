            <h3>Object-oriented databases:<br></h3>
            <p>This type of computers database supports the storage of all data types. The data is stored in the form of objects. The objects to be held in the database have attributes and methods that define what to do with the data. PostgreSQL is an example of an object-oriented relational DBMS.</p>

            <h2><span>Hierarchical</span><span></span></h2>
            <p>This type of DBMS employs the "parent-child" relationship of storing data. Its structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches representing fields. The windows registry used in Windows XP is a hierarchical database example.</p>

            <h2>Graph databases</h2>
            <p>A graph-oriented database uses graph theory to store, map, and query relationships. These kinds of computers databases are mostly used for analyzing interconnections. For example, an organization can use a graph database to mine data about customers from social media.</p>

            <h2>Cloud databases</h2>
            <p>A cloud database is a database which is optimized or built for such a virtualized environment. There are so many advantages of a cloud database, some of which can pay for storage capacity and bandwidth. It also offers scalability on-demand, along with high availability.</p>

            <h2>Data warehouses</h2>
            <p>Data Warehouse is to facilitate a single version of truth for a company for decision making and forecasting. A Data warehouse is an information system that contains historical and commutative data from single or multiple sources. Data Warehouse concept simplifies the reporting and analysis process of the organization.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>OLTP databases</h2>
            <p>OLTP another database type which able to perform fast query processing and maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Multimodal database</h2>
            <p>The multimodal database is a type of data processing platform that supports multiple data models that define how the certain knowledge and information in a database should be organized and arranged</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Document/JSON database</h2>
